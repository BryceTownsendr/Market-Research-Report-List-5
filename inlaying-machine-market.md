<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inlaying Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-pressing Inlaying</li><li>Cold-pressing Inlaying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inlaying machines are categorized into two main types: hot-pressing inlaying and cold-pressing inlaying. Hot-pressing inlaying machines use heat and pressure to embed the inlay material into the workpiece, creating a strong bond. Cold-pressing inlaying machines, on the other hand, do not require heat and rely solely on pressure to secure the inlay material. Both types of machines are commonly used in woodworking and furniture manufacturing industries for adding decorative elements to various products.</p></p>
