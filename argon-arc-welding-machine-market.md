<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Argon Arc Welding Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Melting Pole Argon Arc Welding Machine</li><li>Non-Melting Pole Argon Arc Welding Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Argon arc welding machines can be classified into two main types: melting pole and non-melting pole machines. Melting pole machines involve melting the base metal and adding a filler material to create a weld. On the other hand, non-melting pole machines use a non-consumable tungsten electrode to generate the arc, without melting the base metal. Both types of machines have their respective advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific welding requirements and materials being used.</p></p>
