<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In Vivo Toxicology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chronic Toxicity Testing</li><li>Sub-Chronic Toxicity Testing</li><li>Sub-Acute Toxicity Testing</li><li>Acute Toxicity Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In vivo toxicology market includes various types of testing such as chronic toxicity testing, sub-chronic toxicity testing, sub-acute toxicity testing, and acute toxicity testing. Chronic toxicity testing assesses the effects of prolonged exposure to a substance. Sub-chronic toxicity testing evaluates the impact of repeated exposure over a shorter period. Sub-acute toxicity testing examines the effects of exposure for 1-4 weeks. Acute toxicity testing evaluates the effects of a single or short-term exposure to a substance. These tests are crucial for determining the potential risks of various substances.</p></p>
