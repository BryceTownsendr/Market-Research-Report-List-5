<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Silencers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive</li><li>Reactive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine silencers are classified into two main types based on their functionality: resistive and reactive silencers. Resistive silencers work by absorbing and dissipating sound energy through sound-absorbing materials, whereas reactive silencers use internal ducts and chambers to reflect and cancel out sound waves. Resistive silencers are more commonly used in marine applications where space is limited, while reactive silencers are chosen for their ability to achieve higher noise reduction levels. Both types serve the purpose of reducing noise pollution in marine environments.</p></p>
