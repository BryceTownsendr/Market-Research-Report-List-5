<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystalline Waterproofing Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline Waterproofing Coating</li><li>Crystalline Waterproofing Admixtures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crystalline waterproofing material is divided into two main types - Crystalline Waterproofing Coating and Crystalline Waterproofing Admixtures. Crystalline Waterproofing Coating is applied as a surface treatment to existing structures to provide protection against water infiltration. On the other hand, Crystalline Waterproofing Admixtures are added to concrete mixes to enhance their waterproofing properties from within. Both types of materials work by forming crystalline structures that block the passage of water molecules, making the structure waterproof and durable.</p></p>
