<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chirped Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncoated</li><li>Coated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chirped mirrors are optical devices used to compensate for the dispersion of ultrafast laser pulses. There are two main market types for chirped mirrors: uncoated and coated. Uncoated chirped mirrors are simply mirrors with a designed surface shape to introduce the required dispersion. Coated chirped mirrors, on the other hand, have specific coatings applied to the surface to enhance their performance. The choice between uncoated and coated chirped mirrors depends on the specific application and desired level of performance.</p></p>
