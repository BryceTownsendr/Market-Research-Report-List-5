<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurea Based Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aromatic Based</li><li>Aliphatic Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurea based coatings are classified into two types based on the type of isocyanate used in their formulation - aromatic based and aliphatic based. Aromatic based polyurea coatings are more cost-effective and offer good chemical resistance but tend to yellow over time when exposed to UV light. On the other hand, aliphatic based coatings are more expensive but provide superior UV resistance, color retention, and overall durability, making them ideal for outdoor applications where color stability is crucial.</p></p>
