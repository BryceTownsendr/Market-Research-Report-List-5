<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Temperature-Controlled Containers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Control</li><li>Passive Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active control temperature-controlled containers use a power source to actively regulate and maintain the desired temperature of pharmaceutical products during transportation. These containers are equipped with sensors and cooling systems to ensure precise temperature control. On the other hand, passive control containers rely on insulation and phase change materials to maintain temperature without the use of a power source. They are often used for shorter distances or when continuous power supply is not available. Both types cater to the specific needs of pharmaceutical companies for safe and effective transportation of temperature-sensitive products.</p></p>
