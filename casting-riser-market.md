<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casting Riser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Type</li><li>Blind Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The casting riser market can be divided into two main types: open type and blind type. Open type risers have an open top and are used to provide a passage for gases to escape during solidification, while blind type risers have a closed top and are designed to prevent the entry of gases. Both types serve the purpose of feeding additional molten metal to the casting to compensate for shrinkage and ensure a quality final product. These two types cater to different casting requirements and preferences in the industry.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Casting Riser Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exothermic Riser</li><li>Insulating Riser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Casting risers, such as exothermic risers and insulating risers, are used in the metal casting industry to prevent defects and improve casting quality. Exothermic risers release heat during solidification to feed the casting, while insulating risers maintain molten metal temperature. Both types of risers serve the same purpose of promoting sound castings by reducing shrinkage and porosity. They play a crucial role in optimizing the casting process and ensuring high-quality end products.</p></p>
