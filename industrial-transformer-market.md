<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-Cooled</li><li>Air-Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil-cooled industrial transformers use mineral oil as a coolant to dissipate heat generated during operation. They are commonly used in high-power applications due to their superior cooling properties. Air-cooled industrial transformers, on the other hand, use ambient air to dissipate heat, making them a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly option. While oil-cooled transformers are more efficient in managing heat, air-cooled transformers are simpler in design and require less maintenance. Both types cater to different industrial needs based on power requirements and operating conditions.</p></p>
