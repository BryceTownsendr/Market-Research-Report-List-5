<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvis Compression Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pelvis Compression Plate market can be categorized into two types: locking and non-locking. Locking plates have screws that lock into the plate, providing higher stability and possibly allowing for early weight bearing. Non-locking plates rely on friction between the plate and bone to provide stability. Locking plates are usually preferred for osteoporotic bone or complex fractures, while non-locking plates may be sufficient for simple fractures or younger patients with good bone quality. The choice between the two types depends on the specific needs of the patient and the complexity of the fracture.</p></p>
