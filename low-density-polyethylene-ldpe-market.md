<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Process</li><li>Tubular Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LDPE is a type of thermoplastic made from ethylene and is commonly used in packaging, construction, and agriculture. LDPE is produced through two main processes: Autoclave Process and Tubular Process. Autoclave Process involves polymerization of ethylene under high pressure and temperature, resulting in higher molecular weight and better mechanical properties. Tubular Process, on the other hand, uses a catalyst to polymerize ethylene in a tubular reactor, producing LDPE with lower molecular weight and lower mechanical properties. Both processes have different applications and market demands.</p></p>
