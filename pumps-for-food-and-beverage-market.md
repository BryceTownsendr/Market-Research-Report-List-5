<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Food and Beverage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pumps for the food and beverage market come in two main types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps use rotating impellers to create centrifugal force, pushing the fluid through the system. They are ideal for high flow rate, low viscosity applications. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, use a method of trapping and transporting fluid using a fixed amount of space in the pump. They are better suited for handling viscous fluids or those with solids in them. Both types play a crucial role in the efficient and hygienic transfer of liquids in the food and beverage industry.</p></p>
