<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gel Adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gel adhesion barriers are used in surgical procedures to prevent the formation of adhesions between tissues. There are two main types of gel adhesion barriers - absorbable and non-absorbable. </p><p>Absorbable gel adhesion barriers are designed to degrade and be absorbed by the body over time, providing temporary protection against adhesion formation. Non-absorbable gel adhesion barriers, on the other hand, remain in place indefinitely and provide a more permanent barrier to prevent adhesions from forming. Both types of barriers are important tools in minimizing complications and improving patient outcomes in surgical procedures.</p></p>
