<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Spark Plugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Spark Plugs</li><li>Cold Spark Plugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive spark plugs are classified into two types: hot spark plugs and cold spark plugs. Hot spark plugs are designed to operate at higher temperatures, making them ideal for engines that run at high speeds. They help prevent fouling and ensure efficient combustion. On the other hand, cold spark plugs are designed to dissipate heat quickly, making them suitable for engines that operate at lower speeds or in colder environments. They help prevent pre-ignition and detonation in these conditions. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring optimal engine performance.</p></p>
