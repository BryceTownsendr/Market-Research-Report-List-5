<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental X-ray flat panel detectors are classified into two types: direct conversion and indirect conversion. Direct conversion detectors use a single layer to convert x-ray photons directly into electric charges, offering higher image quality and efficiency. Indirect conversion detectors use scintillator material to convert x-ray photons into light, which is then converted into electric signals. While indirect conversion detectors are more commonly used due to their lower cost, direct conversion detectors are preferred for their superior image quality and speed.</p></p>
