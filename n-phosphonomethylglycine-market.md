<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IDA Process</li><li>Glycine Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, also known as glyphosate, is a widely used herbicide in agriculture. It is produced through two main processes - IDA process and Glycine process. In the IDA process, glyphosate is produced by reacting isopropylamine, formaldehyde, and phosphorous acid. In the Glycine process, glycine is reacted with formaldehyde and phosphorous acid to produce glyphosate. Both processes result in the production of glyphosate, which is a key ingredient in many herbicides used to control weeds in agriculture.</p></p>
