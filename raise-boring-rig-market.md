<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Raise Boring Rig Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Raise-boring</li><li>Down-reaming</li><li>Box-holing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Raise boring rig market consists of three main types: Raise-boring, Down-reaming, and Box-holing. Raise-boring is used to drill large diameter shafts in rock, while Down-reaming is used to increase the diameter of an existing hole. Box-holing involves drilling a smaller diameter shaft from one level to another for the installation of utilities or ventilation. Each type of rig caters to specific drilling needs, with Raise-boring being more commonly used for deep shafts and large tunnels, Down-reaming for expanding existing holes, and Box-holing for smaller scale projects.</p></p>
