<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Trailer Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural trailer tires come in two main types: radial and bias (crossply). Radial agriculture tires are constructed with layers of cord plies that run at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, providing greater flexibility and a larger footprint for improved traction and reduced soil compaction. Bias (crossply) agriculture tires have plies that crisscross at an angle to the direction of travel, offering durability and strength for heavy-duty applications. Both types have their own advantages and are suitable for different farming needs.</p></p>
