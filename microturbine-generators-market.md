<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microturbine Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unrecuperated Microturbines</li><li>Recuperated Microturbines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microturbine generators can be classified into two main types based on their design: unrecuperated microturbines and recuperated microturbines. Unrecuperated microturbines do not utilize waste heat recovery systems, resulting in lower efficiency but simpler design and lower cost. Recuperated microturbines, on the other hand, incorporate waste heat recovery systems to improve efficiency by utilizing the waste heat to preheat the incoming air, resulting in higher overall efficiency levels. Each type offers its own set of advantages and trade-offs for different applications in the market.</p></p>
