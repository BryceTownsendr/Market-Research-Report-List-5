<p><ul><li>Cemented</li><li>Cement Less</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glenoid fossa prosthesis are used in shoulder replacement surgery to mimic the function of the natural shoulder joint. There are two main types of prostheses available - cemented and cementless. Cemented prostheses are fixed to the bone using bone cement, providing immediate stability. Cementless prostheses rely on bone ingrowth for stability, which can take longer but may result in a more natural feeling joint. Both types have their own advantages and potential risks, and the choice of prosthesis depends on various factors including patient age and bone quality.</p></p>
