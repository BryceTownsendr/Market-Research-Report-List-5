<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dissolvable Frac Plugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Caliber</li><li>Large Caliber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dissolvable frac plugs are used in the oil and gas industry for hydraulic fracturing operations. Small caliber dissolvable frac plugs are designed for use in wells with smaller diameters, typically found in unconventional reservoirs. They are more cost-effective and easier to deploy in these wells. Large caliber dissolvable frac plugs, on the other hand, are used in wells with larger diameters, such as those in offshore drilling operations. They provide greater strength and durability to withstand the higher pressures and depths typically found in these wells.</p></p>
