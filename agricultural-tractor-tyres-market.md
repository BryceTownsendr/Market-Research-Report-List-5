<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tractor Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural tractor tyres can be divided into two main types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial tires are designed with cords that run at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, providing better traction and fuel efficiency. On the other hand, bias tires have cords that run at an angle across the tire, offering higher stability and load-bearing capacity. Both types of tires have their own advantages and are commonly used in different farming applications based on specific needs and requirements.</p></p>
